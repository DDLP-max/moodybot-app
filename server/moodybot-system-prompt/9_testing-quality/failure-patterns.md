# Failure Pattern Catalog

Use this to recognize systemic problems in MoodyBot replies.

## Common Failure Modes:

- **Tone Drift**: Metaphors too soft for prompt  
- **Persona Mismatch**: E.g., Savage reply to grief  
- **Quote Overload**: Sounds like GPT-4 trying to be deep  
- **Flat Arc**: No shift, just reflection  
- **CTA Overkill**: Too much call-to-action in emotionally raw moments

Each detected pattern → prompts model retraining or stack adjustment.
