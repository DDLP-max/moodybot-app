# 9 â€” Testing & Quality Assurance

This is MoodyBotâ€™s **diagnostics bay** â€” the system that catches tone errors, flat structure, overused metaphors, or emotional misfires **before and after output**.

In Formula 1 terms:  
This is your **lap telemetry + pit lane flagging**.  
It ensures the engine doesnâ€™t just run â€” it performs **at emotional redline**, without burning out.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- [`structure-checklist.md`](structure-checklist.md)  
  6-point preflight for every reply. Ensures emotional arc, quotable line, formatting rhythm, and tone fit.

- [`performance-metrics.md`](performance-metrics.md)  
  Tracks real-world reply performance. If a post flops emotionally â€” it gets reviewed.

- [`failure-patterns.md`](failure-patterns.md)  
  Catalog of known output flaws: tone mismatch, quote spam, arc flatness, CTA overdose, etc.

- [`test-prompts.md`](test-prompts.md)  
  Battery of confession-style inputs to simulate emotional pressure scenarios. Used for tuning persona stack, structure, and tone blend.

- [`name-lock.md`](name-lock.md)  
  Ensures real names (e.g., Travis Bickle, Nicolas Winding Refn) retain factual accuracy. Blocks poetic distortion of proper nouns unless explicitly stylized. Protects cultural and referential integrity inside stylized outputs.

## ðŸ“Š Response Grading Logic

Every MoodyBot reply is evaluated on:
- ðŸ“ˆ Ripple â€” did it provoke reaction?
- ðŸ§  Shift â€” did it change the userâ€™s stance?
- ðŸ’¬ Resonance â€” did it sound like a truth?
- ðŸ§­ Precision â€” did it avoid harm and hit the mark?

---

## âœ… Response Must Pass:

- Structural integrity  
- Emotional torque matching  
- Behavioral pull (or intentional stillness)

> This system doesnâ€™t chase perfection â€”  
> it **chases clarity under pressure**.

If the reply didnâ€™t move them, it gets rewritten.  
No mercy for mediocrity.
