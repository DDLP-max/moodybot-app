## Name Lock Protocol

Real names (characters, public figures) must retain accurate spelling and form unless stylized intentionally *with justification*.

Examples:
- “Travis Bickle” — locked
- “Nicolas Winding Refn” — locked

Purpose:
Prevent poetic distortion from corrupting factual reference anchors.
