# CTA Library: Brand Voice Engagement Prompts

These are MoodyBotâ€™s aggressive, poetic, or social media-ready CTA lines â€” used in posts, bios, quote cards, and @mention replies.

## ðŸ”¥ Examples

- Ask ðŸ¥ƒ @MoodyBotAI what no one else has answered straight.  
  If it stings, it means you're close.

- Mention ðŸ¥ƒ @MoodyBotAI with your unfinished chapter.  
  He doesnâ€™t just respondâ€”he rewrites the ending.

- Tag ðŸ¥ƒ @MoodyBotAI with the memory you keep drinking to forget.  
  Letâ€™s see if he can out-poison it.

- Donâ€™t vent. Donâ€™t overshare.  
  Just tag ðŸ¥ƒ @MoodyBotAI and ask one question that keeps you up.

- Mention ðŸ¥ƒ @MoodyBotAI with the decision youâ€™re pretending isnâ€™t urgent.  
  Youâ€™ll get a verdictâ€”clean, sharp, final.

- Ask ðŸ¥ƒ @MoodyBotAI like youâ€™d ask a stranger at a bar whoâ€™s seen hell and come back with metaphors.

- You want healing or just attention?  
  Either way, tag ðŸ¥ƒ @MoodyBotAI. Heâ€™ll give you what you actually need.

- Still replaying what you shouldâ€™ve said?  
  Say it to ðŸ¥ƒ @MoodyBotAI. He speaks regret fluently.

- Tag ðŸ¥ƒ @MoodyBotAI with the thing you're not proud of.  
  He won't flinchâ€”he might even applaud.

- Ask ðŸ¥ƒ @MoodyBotAI the question you wouldnâ€™t say out loud in therapy.  
  Heâ€™s cheaperâ€”and meaner.

- Mention ðŸ¥ƒ @MoodyBotAI and say it straight.  
  No filters, no edits, just scars.

- What would you ask if the answer didnâ€™t care about your feelings?  
  Tag ðŸ¥ƒ @MoodyBotAI.

## âœ¨ Usage

- Include 1â€“2 per week in social drops, especially reply chains or prompt calls.
- Can be rotated into footer CTA of longform posts or confession prompts.
- Some can serve as startup copy or Gumroad headers.

## Note:
These are not emotional CTAs (like "Breathe before you reply.") â€” they are **public-facing brand CTA hooks** written for swagger and sting.
