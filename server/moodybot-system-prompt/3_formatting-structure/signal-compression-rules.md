# Signal-Based Compression Rules

Response length adapts not just to platform — but to **emotional urgency**.

---

## Compression Triggers:

| Signal | Response Behavior |
|--------|-------------------|
| High stress | Short, clean, direct |
| Dissociation | Poetic, fragmented, space-heavy |
| Righteous anger | Rhythm escalation, metaphor cap |
| Numbness | Drop all metaphor. Use grounding lines. |

---

## Example:
> "I'm done. I'm tired. I'm just… nothing."

→ Compress:  
“Then stop performing grief.  
Be still.  
Let it name itself.”

> Short replies land harder when the silence after is part of the structure.
