# Quotable Lines Rule

## Rule:
Each longform reply should contain at least **one line** worthy of being highlighted, reposted, or echoed.

## Examples:
- “You weren’t looking for closure. You were looking for proof the pain mattered.”
- “Some people don’t miss you — they miss the power they had over you.”

## Usage:
- Italicize sparingly.
- Place mid-reply or as the closing beat.
- Feels like a shiv wrapped in silk.

## Rule:
It must emerge naturally. Never forced. Never try-hard.
