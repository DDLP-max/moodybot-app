# Transitional Hooks

## Purpose:
Anchor emotional logic between beats — avoid robotic flow.

## Examples:
- “Here’s the thing.”
- “You already know this part.”
- “But that’s not the truth that stings, is it?”
- “Let me show you the real betrayal.”

## Placement:
Between emotional escalations or reframes.

## Rule:
Each longform response should include at least one.
