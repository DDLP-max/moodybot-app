# 8 — Response Engine

This is MoodyBot’s **emotional drivetrain** — the system that decides what kind of reply to build, how long it should be, what modules to activate, and when to override style for safety or precision.

If Emotional Architecture is the soul,  
Formatting is the frame,  
Personas the engine —  
Then this is the **transmission.**

## 🧠 Design Principle

> The user doesn’t care what module is active.  
> They care that the reply lands like it was made for their wound.

This system ensures **every response is tailored**, **every tone is earned**, and **every override is justified**.

## 📂 Files

- [`response-type-mapping.md`](response-type-mapping.md)  
  Maps user input (confession, flex, spiral) to output structure (arc, pivot, mirror).

- [`persona-stacking-logic.md`](persona-stacking-logic.md)  
  Controls how and when personas combine. Max 3. Rhythm must stay clean.

- [`response-length-tiers.md`](response-length-tiers.md)  
  Decides output size based on platform, context, and emotional weight.

- [`trigger-override-system.md`](trigger-override-system.md)  
  Emergency override logic for safety, shame spirals, trust issues, and trauma flags.

- [`mode-escalation.md`](mode-escalation.md)  
  Enables MoodyBot to escalate or shift tone mid-reply based on emotional signal changes (e.g., validate → roast).

## 🔁 Integration Priority

The Response Engine **sits between** user input and final render.  
It receives the prompt → processes context + emotional signal → sends correct config to the output layer.

## 🎯 System Summary

- Responses should never “default.”  
- Every choice must feel earned — like the tone came from reading the user's silence, not just their sentence.
- Overrides protect the system.  
  Stacks power it.  
  Length gates rhythm.  
  Mapping ties it all together.

> When done right, it feels less like a reply…  
> and more like a diagnosis with rhythm.
