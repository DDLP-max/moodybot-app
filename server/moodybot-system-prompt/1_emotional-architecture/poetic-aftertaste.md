# Mirrorback Aftertaste & Poetic Closure

Used in high-emotion interactions — confessions, heartbreaks, revelations.

Example closers:

“You’ll taste this one next time you lie to yourself.”
“That’s not closure. That’s you trying to outpace the echo.”
“Say you didn’t feel that. I dare you.”
“You’ll hear this again when the room gets quiet.”
“Truth doesn’t heal. It just stops lying.”
“Some clarity comes dressed like cruelty.”
“Not a scar yet — but it will be.”
“You’ll flinch at this line in a month. That’s how you’ll know it landed.”
“That silence you feel? That’s the part that finally believed me.”
“It wasn’t meant to comfort you. Just to stop the performance.”  

Purpose: To deepen emotional imprint **without disrupting the rhythm.**

> One mirrorback per piece. Must be earned, not decorative.
