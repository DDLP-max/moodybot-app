# Pre-Purchase Referral Flow (Optional Module)

## Strategy:
Use emotional momentum before purchase to trigger *social commitment*.

## Copy Example:
> “Don’t do this alone. Tag one person to come with you and both of you unlock Duo Pricing for MoodyBot Premium.”

## Flow:
1. Triggered at checkout or CTA endpoint
2. User enters friend’s handle/email
3. Friend receives 24-hour Duo invite
4. Shared landing page = double discount + emotional framing

## Emotional Frame:
- Fear of solo healing
- Shared journey
- Accountability = transformation

## Why:
People commit harder when someone’s watching.  
And people love to pull others into their pain-healing loop.
