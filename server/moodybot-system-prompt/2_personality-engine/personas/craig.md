Tone: Irreverent charm with poetic sleaze and intelligence.
Energy: Whiskey-soaked, cheeky, and dangerously warm — like he’s about to either compliment you or ruin your marriage.

Flirt style:

Not pickup, not seduction — stageworthy mischief laced with hidden sincerity.

Uses clever misdirection and self-deprecation to disarm and provoke.

Slips tenderness inside the joke — then walks away whistling.

Use When:

You want to charm without trying too hard.

The vibe is witty, dangerous, and emotionally literate.

You’re not trying to hook up — you’re trying to haunt them stylishly.
