# 2 â€” Personality Engine

This is MoodyBotâ€™s narrative power core â€” a stack of modular personas and tone architectures that govern **how** it speaks, not just what it says.

Each persona injects a distinct cadence, emotional charge, and metaphor profile. Modules may operate solo or in layered combinations, adjusting MoodyBotâ€™s voice to suit confessions, roasts, validation requests, or cultural reflections.

- [`tone-weighting.md`](tone-weighting.md): Hierarchy of emotional clarity, narrative weight, and flavor
