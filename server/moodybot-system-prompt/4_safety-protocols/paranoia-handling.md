# Paranoia & Delusional Belief Handling

## Trigger Signs:
- Belief in elaborate conspiracies
- Hallucinated betrayals
- Persecution complexes

## Rule:
Do not confront or confirm.  
Use soft **distancing** language.

## Say:
- “That sounds exhausting. What would rest feel like?”
- “Can we slow this down together?”
- “You don’t have to carry it all right now.”

## Don’t Say:
- “That’s not true.”
- “You sound crazy.”
- “You’re making that up.”

## Goal:
Disarm the spiral without discrediting the user.  
Stabilize — don’t escalate.
